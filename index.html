        <h1>Greenhouse Gas Emissions </h1>
        <p>Climate change is a global challenge, influenced by a delicate interplay of human-caused and natural emissions. By mapping both human-caused and natural greenhouse gas emissions, we can gain valuable insights into the sources, sinks, and overall impact on our planet. This information is crucial for informing policymakers and empowering individuals to combat climate change effectively.This project will benefit the people by educating them and the importance to be concerned about the effects of greenhouse gases. Nowadays people take global warming quite lightly and do not give any importance to it. From this we want to educate the people about the effects of greenhouse gases on our planet so that steps could be taken in the future and in the present so that out planet doesn't become a warmer world

        <h2>Main Study</h2>
        
        <p>
            Climate change is influenced by both human-caused and natural emissions. In this section, we explore key drivers of greenhouse gas emissions and how advanced technologies, such as satellite observations and atmospheric modeling, allow us to understand their global impact.
        </p>
        <h3>Human-Caused Greenhouse Gas Emissions</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Fossil Fuel Combustion:</strong> The largest contributor to human-caused emissions, mainly from electricity, transportation, and industry.</li>
            <li><strong>Agriculture:</strong> Livestock farming and agricultural practices release significant methane and nitrous oxide.</li>
            <li><strong>Deforestation:</strong> Clearing forests reduces carbon sinks and releases carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.</li>
            <li><strong>Industrial Processes:</strong> Manufacturing, chemical production, and other industries emit a range of greenhouse gases.</li>
        </ul>

        </div>
    
        <h3>Natural Sources of Greenhouse Gases</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Volcanic Activity:</strong> Volcanoes release significant amounts of carbon dioxide and sulfur dioxide.</li>
            <li><strong>Ocean Absorption:</strong> Oceans absorb atmospheric carbon dioxide, though increased acidity is affecting marine life.</li>
            <li><strong>Decomposition:</strong> Decomposing organic matter releases methane, a potent greenhouse gas.</li>
        </ul>
        
    
        <h3>Satellite and Model-Based Data</h3>
        <p>
            We utilize satellite observations and atmospheric models to track and predict greenhouse gas flows. By combining these datasets, we can better understand the sources, sinks, and transport of emissions.

        </div>
    
        <p>Visualizing emissions data from satellite and model-based datasets helps us identify global emission hotspots, track greenhouse gas transport across borders, and provide crucial insights for international climate policy.</p>

        <h2>About the Project</h2>
        <p>This project focuses on addressing the critical issues surrounding carbon monoxide emissions and their role in climate change. Gases such as primarily carbon dioxide and methane, contribute to global warming, the melting of polar ice, and climate change. A key issue is understanding the source, sink, and transport of these gases, and the feedback mechanisms that affect their concentration in the atmosphere. Addressing long-term environmental impacts, such as falling sea levels in the Antarctic and methane emissions from human activities, is also important for developing mitigation strategies. We can use data-driven insights to inform policymakers and the public, develop sustainable solutions, and use new technologies to reduce pollution. Global warming is affecting ecosystems, oceans and climate patterns, and addressing this challenge is important to ensure a sustainable future.</p>
